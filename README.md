# What is the tutorial about?

This repository takes a step-by-step tour of creating a responsive PyQt5 app.

Let us first understand the basics of PyQt;

- creating widgets
- laying out widgets
- creating signal and slots

# PyQt5: What is it?

- PyQt5 is a Python binding for Qt5 framwork. It provides wrappers for around 600 classes of Qt5
- let us focus on the User Interface. However PyQt provides wrappers  various other Qt tools like
requests handling, drawing, etc
- Qt employs a hierarchial object oriented framework where every object inherits from the QtObject;
base class
- User interface objects inherit from QWidget class, child of the QObject class
- Various objects like QLineEdit, QSlider, QComboBox, QGroup Box are there
- A widget can nest in another widget enabling a Matroshka style of interface

# ReadSlider: 0

- My first PyQt app 
- In this tutorial, let us progressively build a PyQt App in which we read
the state value (the slider Position) of a QWidget like Slider
and write the state value to another QWidget like the QTextEdit.
- Step 0: Create a slider object

---

# ReadSlider: 1

- Step 1: I do not know how to get the state value of the slider.
Instead let me try it with QLineEdit. So create a pair of LineEdit in a 
Vertical Box Layout

---

# ReadSlider: 2

- Step 2: Slot one of the LineEdit's signal to the slot of other LineEdit
and vice versa

---

# ReadSlider: 3

- Step 3: Read the LineEdit value and print to standard output

---

# ReadSlider: 4

- Step 4: Finally 
Create the Slider and LineEdit widgets.
Read the slider value and writer to the line Edit widget.

---

# ReadSlider: Freeze the app

- In Pythonic world, freezing is creating self-contained executable (packaging) from source code.
 This involves compiling, linking, including and building binaries
- There are various libraries to handle freezing like py2exe, py2app. Freezing PyQt apps is a hard problem
- [fbs](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs) fman's  build system helps in freezing PyQt GUI apps;
 fman is the next generation file manager for programmers.

  fbs run
